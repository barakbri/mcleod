Monday: Vignette

Add example for:
( ) get density by iteration,
( ) get CDF by iteration
( ) get posterior mean/ median of density

( ) get beta by iteration
( ) get proposals by iteration
( ) get was proposal accepted by iteration 

( )  get CIs from object
( )  add function for finding gamma_i for data (train and test)
( )  add function for finding prediction CIs ( for the non-covariate case and the covariate case)

( )  Explain on init for Beta regression


Tuesday: - add code examples to documentation, unit test


later:
- add warning rho is muliple of grid size
- add code examples to documentation
- unit test - add simple use cases
- register function for printing main object and CI object.
- add citations to papers and dissertation
