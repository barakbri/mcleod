#todo

- finish documentation for internal functions:
  mcleod.CI.rho.calibration.constructor
  compute_CI_curves_function
  init_mcleod_random_intercept_regression
  
later tasks (Imp/Doc/Vignette):
I get density by iteration,
I get CDF by iteration
I get posterior mean/ median of density

I get beta by iteration
I get proposals by iteration
I get was proposal accepted by iteration 

I get CIs from object

I add function for init regression parameters

I add function for finding gamma_i for data (train and test)
I add function for finding prediction CIs ( for the non-covariate case and the covariate case)

later:
- add warning rho is muliple of grid size
- add code examples to documentation
- unit test - add simple use cases
- register function for printing main object and CI object.
- add citations to papers and dissertation
