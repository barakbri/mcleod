#todo

- finish documentation for internal functions:
  mcleod.CI.rho.calibration.constructor
  compute_CI_curves_function
  
later tasks:
- get density by iteration,
- get CDF by iteration
- get posterior mean/ median of density
- get CIs from object
- get beta by iteration
- get proposals by iteration
- add check rho is muliple of grid size
- add function for init regression parameters


later tasks 2:
- add function for finding gamma_i for data (train and test)
- add function for finding prediction CIs given X_i (or for the non-covariate case).

- add code examples to documentation
- unit test - add simple use cases
- register function for printing main object and CI object.
- add citations to papers and dissertation
