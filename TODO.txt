#todo

- finish documentation for internal functions:
  mcleod.CI.rho.calibration.constructor
  compute_CI_curves_function
D  init_mcleod_random_intercept_regression
D add function for init regression parameters

later tasks (Imp/Doc/Vignette):
D get density by iteration,
D get CDF by iteration
D get posterior mean/ median of density

D get beta by iteration
D get proposals by iteration
D get was proposal accepted by iteration 

I add function for finding gamma_i for data (train and test)
I add function for finding prediction CIs ( for the non-covariate case and the covariate case)

I get CIs from object


later:
- add warning rho is muliple of grid size
- add code examples to documentation
- unit test - add simple use cases
- register function for printing main object and CI object.
- add citations to papers and dissertation
