- compute p_k_i without allocation
- beta also for two layer dirichlet - try to make as concise as possible
- check beta with dimension larger than 1

- simple integration step constant as parameter
- fast gamma also for 2-layer dirichlet
- other noise mechanisms
- quadrature integration
- p_k_i - memoization?

- check inputs
- split to two functions - with and without covariates

- unit test
- documentation
-vignette
