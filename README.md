Monday
- compute p_k_i without allocation - requires rewriting a 1-piece instead of a twopiece function...
- trapezoid rule/simpsons rule?
- beta parameters also for two layer dirichlet - try to make as concise as possible

Tuesday-Wednesday
- simple integration step constant as parameter
- fast gamma also for 2-layer dirichlet
- other noise mechanisms


Thursday
- check inputs
- split to two functions - with and without covariates
- unit test
- documentation
- vignette


- quadrature integration
- p_k_i - memoization for integration values?
